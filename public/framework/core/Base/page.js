/**
 * You CAN override initialize() via new Base({ initialize(){} });
 * You CANNOT override instantiate() via new Base({ instantiate() {} });
 * 
 * Also, providing examples of basic JavaScript principles:
 * - how this works: initialize(){ this? } vs initialize: () => { this? }
 * - extension, inheritance, instanceof, prototype, static, props, constructor, etc
 * 
 * 
 * Why can't we override constructor?
 * The problem is something like, you can't call this.method() then super.constructor() or whatever.  Basically, the base constructor has to come first, which is a silly limitation.
 * So we use instantiate?  What if we don't need instantiate?  It's sometimes helpful...
